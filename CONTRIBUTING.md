# Contributing guidelines
Thanks for your interest in contributing! 

If you'd like to contribute, please make sure your code is actually nicely formatted, it doesn't matter if you rewrite the linux kernel in a pull request, if your code is unreadable, we don't accept it, sorry.

Apart from that, just please don't try commit your shitty backdoors to our repo! They will get reverse engineered (and we don't want to backdoor our shit anyway!)

Also, please don't do troll pulls.

I don't mind how small the change is, if it's something important it'll get accepted (as long as you follow the previous requests!)
